The user plays against an AI player that chooses its next best move based on where the user's disks are. The AI player makes their next move by choosing the spot that will change the most pieces' color(to their advantage).

In order to play against the computer, the user must select a viable spot on the board or else nothing will happen. The user will continue to play against the computer until there are no possible moves. Once the game is over, the board will fill up with the pieces of the color of the winner.
